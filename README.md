# Random_Delay_Sampling
In this repository, I sampled a Delay Differential Equation (DDE) with random delay. This method is used when the value for the delay is uncertain.
The model I chose, from C. Letellier et al., is not verified with an experimental procedure, therefore the value used for the delay may be
better modeled by a combination of random delays than by an arbitrarily assigned value.
